- Create a user ("nextmon") to display the predictions
    - Ideally, set up lightdm to autologin your "nextmon" user --- I couldn't
      get this to work, though.
- In the GNOME/Unity settings
    - Go to "Startup Applications" and add "firefox
      http://nextmon.scripts.mit.edu/display/" to the list of applications run
      on startup
    - Go to "Brightness and Lock", and update the settings appropriately. You
      probably want to turn off "Lock", and may want to change the "Turn off
      screen when inactive for..." setting to "never".
    - In "Appearance" -> "Behavior", set "Autohide the launcher" to "ON".
- In Firefox, select "View" -> "Full Screen" (F11)
- Tweak the width of the map in the HTML source
- If you want to set up remctl'd screen unblanking
    - Check out the repo in /etc/nextmon-display/
    - Install remctl-server 3.1 or later. On a Precise machine:
        - Add quantal to your sources.list
        - Symlink /etc/nextmon-display/local/apt-pin.conf into
          /etc/apt/preferences.d/
        - apt-get update && apt-get install remctl-server
    - Symlink /etc/nextmon-display/local/remctl.conf into /etc/remctl/conf.d/
